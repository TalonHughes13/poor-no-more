# PoorNoMore for Divvy Interview

A simple budgeting app made with React and Phoenix that allowed me to dive into Elixir/Phoenix for the first time. I learned so much and I am stoked to continue to develop with these tools. Below are the steps you need to follow to get the app up and running.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * go back to the root `cd ../`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
